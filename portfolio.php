                                                        Here's the thing about resumes and cover letters: No matter how unique you try to make your own, for the most part, they tend to read dry.

And while being concise is good, there's very little opportunity to convey your uniqueness, or for your personality to shine through at all for that matter.

                                                        While a resume is a sole, largely unchanging document, a personal website can be customized and updated according to what you're working on, or what you want to emphasize. It's both fluid and current.
